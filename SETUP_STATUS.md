## 🎯 LearnMate Setup Status

### ✅ **Current Status**
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000 ✅
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3001 ✅
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (client-side auth working) ⚠️

### 🔧 **What's Working**

2. ✅ Backend Express server starts successfully  
3. ✅ Frontend Firebase authentication (Google Sign-In, Email/Password)

5. ✅ All TypeScript compilation issues resolved

### ⚠️ **Known Limitations**
- Backend Firebase Admin SDK needs proper service account key for full database operations

2. **Sign up/Sign in**: Use the authentication system
3. **Dashboard**: View your personalized learning dashboard

2. Select your project: "error-404-6b343"
3. Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
4. Generate a new private key
